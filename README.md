## 1. Any.do Mobile Apps
Any.do is an application that is used for task management, reminding, and scheduling. You can add a task to list, remove a task, or adding a task within a specific time.
### 1.1 What's bad?
- **Task cannot be scheduled automatically** this makes the schedule looks not organized, and difficult to search.
- **No warning when creating same task** this makes the plan can consist of multiple same items.

### 3.1 What's bad?

- **Same in visuals but different functions** sometimes I forgot where is the right switch that i want to turn on.
- **Inconsistent**, the switch will turn on the light if I press it down, but there are some kinds of switches that also will turn on when I press it up.

### 3.2 Suggestion
- ** Give the switch different label or color ** will make it easy to know the functionality of the switches.
- ** Install smart detector switches ** , for example : clapping sensor, voice sensor.

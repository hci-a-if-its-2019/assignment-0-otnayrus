## 1. Any.do Mobile Apps
Any.do is an application that is used for task management, reminding, and scheduling. You can add a task to list, remove a task, or adding a task within a specific time.

### 1.2 Suggestion
- Automatically sorting list when a task is added to the list
- Double checking multiple task confirmation
